## Tools for three-point contact maps 

This is a draft of a library to work with 3-point contact HI-C contact maps, produced by tools such as Tri-C. 
It includes some basic tools for working with 3-point contact "tensors" such as: 

* Matrix balancing (Iterative correction)
* Add transpose / leave trui elements only
* 4 versions of 3-point "Expected" 
* Tools for extracting 3-point maps from polymer conformations
